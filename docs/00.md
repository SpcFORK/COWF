# COWF
### Language subset for quick things
---

Cowf is a language for Static purposes or Dynamic coding.

Cowfiles are multimedia filetype, which support for the use of code, and or dynamics in order to create programs and or optimized filetypes.

---

### Why

---

Cowf aims to solve one specific issue, complexity.

Most people go ahead implementing filetypes for one specific purpose, and usually done well, makes a fast and robust environment for data.

These formats are usually static though, as to save against lossyness, and the other dangers of dynamics and non-static environments.

Cowf, however aims to reach this dynamic possibility by being as simple and robust.

Cowf achieves it's abilities by splitting specifically by breaks in words and spaces and other patterns.

### Cowf Headers

```cowf
=) someEngine
```

Cowf Headers are like the Magic on most filetypes, 

only that COWF headers are more useful and describe the engine to understand the file.
