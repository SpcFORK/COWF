# Cowf - HTML

```htmf
=) htmf

=> Doc html lang="en"

=> Head head
=> Body body

<+ Doc Head Body

=> Content p
<+ Body Content

! -Returns-
Doc
```

Elements are defined with => followed by the element name and tag.
The hierarchical structure of elements is established using <+, which denotes child-parent relationships.

The document returns the root element, marking the end of the content definition.

Using this format, creating and managing HTML document structures in Cowf can be efficient and clear, benefiting from a robust and simple syntactical approach.
